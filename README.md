# Project get_next_line

## Module 1 of 42 Common Core

### Main objective:

Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor, you have to read one line at a time. 
Your function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred,
it should return NULL. The returned line should include the `\n` except if it was the end of file.

Global variables, lseek() and libft are forbidden.

### Bonus objective:

Your function now should be able to read multiple file descriptors at the same time.
